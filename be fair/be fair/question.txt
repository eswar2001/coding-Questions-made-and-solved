You are Sai Varma the HOD of the school and there are two school kids Sai Naidu and rishi kanth. You have n BubbleGum. You have to distribute these n BubbleGum between two school kids in such a way that:
->Both students will get greater than 0
->each school kid will get some integer number of BubbleGum;
->Sai Naidu will get a greater amount of BubbleGum than rishi kanth (i.e. a>b);
->all the BubbleGum will be given to one of two school kids (i.e. a+b=n).
Your task is to calculate the number of ways to distribute exactly n BubbleGum's between school kids in a way described above. BubbleGum are indistinguishable.

Formally, find the number of ways to represent n as the sum of n=a+b, where a and b are positive integers and a>b.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1≤t≤10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The only line of a test case contains one integer n (1≤n≤2⋅10^9) — the number of BubbleGum you have.

Output
For each test case, print the answer — the number of ways to distribute exactly n BubbleGum between two school kids in a way described in the problem statement. If there is no way to satisfy all the conditions, print 0.
