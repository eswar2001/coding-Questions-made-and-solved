You're given an arbitrary 32-bit integer n. Take its binary representation, split bits into pairs (bit number 0 and 1, bit number 2 and 3, etc.) and swap bits in each pair. Then return the result as a decimal number.

Example

For n = 13, the output should be
swapAdjacentBits(n) = 14.

1310 = 11012 ~> {11}{01}2 ~> 11102 = 1410.

For n = 74, the output should be
swapAdjacentBits(n) = 133.

7410 = 010010102 ~> {01}{00}{10}{10}2 ~> 100001012 = 13310.
Note the preceding zero written in front of the initial number: since both numbers (Input and Output) are 32-bit integers, they have 32 bits in their binary representation. The preceding zeros in other cases don't matter, so they are omitted. Here, however, it does make a difference.

INPUT:

    - The first line contains number of test cases (T).
    - The next T lines contains an integer n.

OUTPUT:

    - print integer number of each n by swapping adjacent pair bits.

Sample Test Case:

2
13
74

Sample Test Case Output:

14
133

Guaranteed constraints:
1 <= T <= 1000
0 ≤ n < 2^30
