Here's some new type of question to solve there is data being sent from one device to another.so they are encrypted by 
this algotithm/technique 'Y2Flc2FyLWNpcGhlcg==' and this algotithm/technique name is in base(pow(2,6)) and I assume a key is required to 
find the exact decrypted data.
Tasks you have to do to solve this problem:-
1)decode this Y2Flc2FyLWNpcGhlcg==
2)find the key in this website https://bit.ly/Huntforkey

Note:- It's better that you find find the key in the website rather than brute force. 
input:-
no of meaasges
<messages>

output:-
<decoded messages>

sample input:-(assuming the key you found in the website is 1)
