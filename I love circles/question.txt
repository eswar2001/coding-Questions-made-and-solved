Given two circles.You have to find all lines that touch both circles simultaneously.
If there are no such possible lines then print nothing.
Print those lines after sorting as follows:-
-If value of a are different, then line with higher a gets better rank.
-If value of a are same, then line with higher c value gets better rank.
-If value of a are same and value of c are also same, then line with greater b gets better rank.

(x1,y1),(x2,y2) center of circle 
r1,r2 radii of circles
ax+by+c=0 tangent line equation
input format
no of test cases
x1 y1 r1 x2 y2 r2

output format
a b c

Sample input:-
2
0 0 3 0 1 3
208 228 592 73 403 677

Sample output:-
1 0 3
1 0 -3
0.97 0.26 -8.5e+02
0.5 0.87 2.9e+02


Note:- setprecision to 2 decimal points
       radii of circle should be positive 
       so use abs in c++ while calculating
       If your using other languages then google it guys.
