A person who has interest in mathematics suggested by another friend to read a novel. But this person 
given a problem for his friend in return.
The problem is: 
Suppose if the person has used X digits to print numbers to each page of novel, which starts from 1 to N.
Now his friend need to find the value of N for the given value of X

Input:

- First line of input contains the number of test cases T.
- The following T lines contains the value of X in each case.

Output:

-The output of each testcase is single integer N.

Sample Input:
	
	2
	20
	21

Sample Output:
	
	14
	15

Constraints:

1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= N <= 10^5

Explaination:

for sample testcase1 you can see he used 20 digits: 

page.no no.of digits used
	
   1		1
   2		1
   3		1
   4		1
   5		1
   6		1
   7		1
   8		1
   9		1
  10		2
  11		2
  12		2
  13		2
  14		2
	------------------
		19           --> "we cannot print page.no 15 with 1 digit"
	------------------
So Output is 14
